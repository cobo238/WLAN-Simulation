# WLAN-Simulation
IEEE 802.11 Based Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Simulation

### How to Run Code

To run the script from the Linux command line:

$ chmod +x run_sim.sh  
$ ./run_sim.sh

To run other lambda and other total number of hosts:

$ make  
$ ./main {lambda} {number of hosts}

Do not include brackets  
Lambda is from 0 to 1 amd the number of hosts can only be positive integers
